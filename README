# Peppa REST API test harness

This is a barebones  Appcelerator Titanium project that uses my Peppa REST API, a module for Drupal 7.

The test harness is written using Alloy and has a widget for each API functional set.i.e. one for the user functionality and one for the object functionality.

This is not meant to be an example Alloy project, but a way of testing the Peppa API from a mobile device.
